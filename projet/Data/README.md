# Healthcare Dashboard Project

## Project Overview
This project involves creating an interactive and insightful dashboard in Power BI to visualize, monitor, and analyze the patient waiting lists across multiple metrics. The dashboard provides a high-level summary as well as detailed insights into specific specialties, age profiles, and waiting list trends over time. 

## Problem Statement
The primary goal of this project is to address the healthcare organization's need to manage and understand patient waiting lists more effectively. By tracking current and historical data, the dashboard enables stakeholders to monitor trends and identify areas for improvement in patient management.

## Objectives
1. **Track the current status of the patient waiting list** for real-time decision-making.
2. **Analyze historical trends** in waiting lists across Inpatient and Outpatient categories.
3. **Provide a detailed analysis** at specialty and age profile levels to identify bottlenecks and improvement areas.

## Data Scope
- **Time Period**: 2018 – 2021
- **Data Types**: Inpatient & Outpatient patient waiting list records

## Metrics
The dashboard captures several key metrics essential for comprehensive analysis:
- **Average & Median Waiting List**: Understand the central tendencies of the waiting list durations.
- **Current Total Waiting List**: Track the total number of patients on the waiting list in real-time.
